    <h1>Mahabharata - Indian History</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><a href="https//:www.google.com">Google Me</a>Mahabharata is a sacred epic poem that tells about the struggles faced between two groups of cousins to gain supreme power. One of them was the Kauravas (hundred sons of King Dhritarashtra), and the other group was the Pandavas (five sons of Pandu). These two rival families opposed each other in a war to gain possession of their ancestral Bharata kingdom and also the capital, Hastinapur. The story begins with Pandu, as the king, who was skilled in warfare and archery. His cousin-brother, Dhritarashtra, was the eldest, and was barred from being the king because he was blind. When the political and social affairs of the kingdom were running smoothly under the power of Pandu, he decided to hand over the state affairs to his blind brother Dhritarashtra and retreated into the forest with his two wives for some time. When they returned, Pandu and his wife Madri were not alive. Kunti, Pandu's other wife returned to the kingdom with her five sons called the Pandavas. The sons were fathered by five gods since a curse prevented Pandu from being a father. On the other hand, King Dhritarashtra had 100 sons called the Kauravas, and were considered human incarnations of demons, according to the text. The Kauravas were jealous and treated their cousins (the Pandavas) brutally. Yudhisthira, the eldest of the Pandavas was the next king to the throne since he was older than Duryodhana. Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas did not approve of this decision. Hostility and enmity started developing among the cousins which compelled the Pandavas to leave the kingdom. During their first exile, the Kauravas conspired and plotted a plan to kill the Pandavas by setting up fire in a mansion made with highly flammable materials. Although this plan failed, the Kauravas were desperate to destroy the Pandavas.</p>

    <h3>Historical context</h3>
    <p>The historicity of the Kurukshetra War is unclear. Many historians estimate the date of the Kurukshetra war to Iron Age India of the 10th century BCE.[46] The setting of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age (Vedic) India, where the Kuru kingdom was the center of political power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE.[47] A dynastic conflict of the period could have been the inspiration for the Jaya, the foundation on which the Mahābhārata corpus was built, with a climactic battle, eventually coming to be viewed as an epochal event.</p>
    <h3>Accretion and redaction</h3>
    <p>Research on the Mahābhārata has put an enormous effort into recognizing and dating layers within the text. Some elements of the present Mahabharata can be traced back to Vedic times.[23] The background to the Mahābhārata suggests the origin of the epic occurs "after the very early Vedic period" and before "the first Indian 'empire' was to rise in the third century B.C." That this is "a date not too far removed from the 8th or 9th century B.C."[7][24] is likely. The Mahabharata started as an orally-transmitted tale of the charioteer bards.[25] It is generally agreed that "Unlike the Vedas, which have to be preserved letter-perfect, the epic was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform to changes in language and style,"[24] so the earliest 'surviving' components of this dynamic text are believed to be no older than the earliest 'external' references we have to the epic, which include an reference in Panini's 4th century BCE grammar Ashtadhyayi 4:2:56.[7][24] Vishnu Sukthankar, editor of the first great critical edition of the Mahābhārata, commented: "It is useless to think of reconstructing a fluid text in an original shape, based on an archetype and a stemma codicum.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>On hearing of the death of their friend Krishna, the Pandav brothers place Parikshit, the grandson of Arjun, on the throne, and retire to the Himalayas. Draupadi drops down dead on the way, then Sahadeva, then Nakula, then Arjun, and then Bhima. Yudhishthir alone proceeds to heaven in person in a celestial car.</p>
